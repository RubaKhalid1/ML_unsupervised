# Eye Diseases Classification üëÅÔ∏è
## Introduction
Eye diseases are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, affecting millions of individuals and significantly impacting quality of life. Conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts often develop gradually and may go unnoticed until irreversible damage has occurred. Early and accurate diagnosis is therefore essential for timely treatment and vision preservation. This project focuses on developing a system for eye disease classification, aiming to support ophthalmologists in identifying and differentiating between common eye conditions more efficiently and accurately. By leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to contribute to the early detection and prevention of blindness.

## Problem Statement
Despite the critical importance of early diagnosis, many eye diseases remain undetected until they reach advanced stages, often leading to irreversible vision loss or blindness. There is a growing need for an automated, reliable, and efficient system that can assist in the early detection and classification of common eye diseases. This project aims to address this gap by developing a machine learning-based solution capable of accurately classifying eye diseases from retinal images.

## Dataset
 A total of 5335 images of healthy and affected eye images were collected from Anwara Hamida Eye Hospital in Faridpur and BNS Zahrul Haque Eye Hospital in Faridpur district with the help of the hospital authorities. Then from these original images, a total of 15090 augmented images are produced by using brightness to adjusts the brightness of the input image to increase the number of data.
